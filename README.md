Module 14 Challenge

## Project Description:
This is the assignment submission for challenge #14- Bellybutton Challenge. 

## Getting Started and Installation:
This github provides the index.html and app.js files as well as the samples.json for reference. In order to actually view the website, go to my github page at https://github.com/Duckferd/belly-button-challenge.

Using the page is very simple- select a subject from the drop down menu. A horizontal bar chart will display their top 10 OTUs (bacterial population) in their belly button. The bubble chart will display the same info but in a different chart form.

## The following are uploaded to Github:
* static folder with app.js
* data folder with samples.json
* index.html, the main webpage for viewing
* README file (this!)
